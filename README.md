### Hi, I’m Chris 👋

I'm a 21 year old developer and founder.

## 🔭 Current

Currently, I am dedicated to enhancing my portfolio by crafting impressive projects that demonstrate my expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies. 
As part of this effort, I am motivated to contribute to established open-source projects, transitioning from my previous focus on closed-source work.

## ⚡️ Experience

I highly leverage Go to build future-proof, performant and scalable backends, and I pair that with React on the frontend. I've been working with React for about 3 years, Go for 1, and JavaScript/TypeScript and Java for almost 6.
